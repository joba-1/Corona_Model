        Sets schedule-attribute to original_schedule.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    get_infectivity()
        Returns the infectivity of infected agent.
        Should theoretically be based on the duration of the infection and
        the personal behaviour.
        For now it is set to the default-value of 1; so nothing changes,
        with respect to the previous version.
