    get_infected()
        Determines whether an agent gets infected, at the current location and time.
        Changes status-attribute to 'I', writes current location to 'place_of_infection',
        writes current time to infection_time-attribute and sets was_infected-attribute to True.

        diagnosis_time-attribute.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    get_rehospitalized()
        Determines whether an agent gets out of ICU and back to the normal
        hospital-bed, based on rehospitalization-probability.
        Changes hospitalized-attribute to 'True', writes current time to
        rehospitalization_time-attribute. Sets icu-attribute to False.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

        Changes icu-attribute to 'True', writes current time to
        icu_time-attribute. Sets hospitalized-attribute to False.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    die()
        Determines whether an agent dies,
        based on personal_risk-probability.

        Sets icu-,hospitalized- and diagnosed-attribute to False.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    recover()
        Determines whether an agent recovers,
        based on recover-probability.
        Changes status-attribute to 'R', records current time to recover_time-attribute.
        Sets icu-,hospitalized- and diagnosed-attribute to False.
        Sets schedule-attribute to original_schedule.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    get_infectivity()
        Returns the infectivity of infected agent.
        Should theoretically be based on the duration of the infection and
        the personal behaviour.
        For now it is set to the default-value of 1; so nothing changes,
        with respect to the previous version.
