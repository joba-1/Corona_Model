        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    get_rehospitalized()
        Determines whether an agent gets out of ICU and back to the normal
        hospital-bed, based on rehospitalization-probability.
        Changes hospitalized-attribute to 'True', writes current time to
        rehospitalization_time-attribute. Sets icu-attribute to False.

        Sets schedule-attribute to original_schedule.
        Arguments to provide are: probability (float), time (int)

    get_infectivity()
        Returns the infectivity of infected agent.
        Should theoretically be based on the duration of the infection and
        the personal behaviour.
        For now it is set to the default-value of 1; so nothing changes,
        with respect to the previous version.

    get_infection_info()
