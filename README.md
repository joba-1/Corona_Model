# TBP HU-Berlin SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission ABM 

## General Information
The information regarding the data used in this model as well as its documentation and developer information can be found in this repository's [wiki](https://ford.biologie.hu-berlin.de/jwodke/corona_model/-/wikis/home).

This model is maintained by the [Klipp lab for theoretical biophysics](https://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/tbp/index.php/en/) at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin.

Python commands are highlighted by green color throughout this document.

## Usage
To run the model, the jupyter notebook [RUN_CoronaABM.ipynb](https://ford.biologie.hu-berlin.de/jwodke/corona_model/-/blob/development/RUN_CoronaABM.ipynb) is provided.

This notebook contains the commands required to initialize a modeled world (using a small version (10%) of Gangelt) and to run GERDA simulations, including manual adjustment of parameters for 'infectivity', 'mean interaction frequency', and 'non-compliance probability'.

General commands:
\textbullet a world is initialized by:
\textcolor{blue}{COMMAND}
\textbullet a simulation is run by:
COMMAND

For comparative simulations, the same initialized world has to be used for the initial simulations. If non-pharmaceutical interventions shall be testet, the simulation has to be split into consecutive runs. The first simulation, simulation1, (using the modeled world as input and starting at time T=0) is run until the time point the intervention starts. For the consecutive simulation, the intervention has to be defined, e.g. for 'close all locations' (to represent a full lockdown) the location closure has to be incorporated by the following loop:
for loc in simulation1.locations:
    loc.close()
The second simulation, simulation2, (using simulation1 as input and starting at T=finalTime of simulation1) sebsequently is run until the end time of the tested intervention. For the third simulation, simulation3, (using simulation2 as input and starting at T=finalTime of simulation2) the closure of locations has to be reset:
for loc in simulation2. locations:
    loc.reset()

An example for comparative simulations (close all, reopen all) is already shown in cells XXX.
See the RUN_CoronaABM.ipynb for the most recent visualization options.

More options are currently continuously added on a daily basis. Please contact us (coronaModel@hu-berlin.de), if the notebook is not working or if the information is oudated.
