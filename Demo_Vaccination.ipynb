    "# Vaccination (Demo)\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the simulations, which were performed to evaluate the different vaccination-strategies in our [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248301v1), we generated a jupyter notebook. We suggest to get familiar with the `Demo.ipynb` notebook first, in order to get an intuition for our model and its basic application and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook subdivied the following code blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [\"Initiate world\"](#buildW) - initialize small or large world for Gangelt (small = 10% of population and buildings, large = 100% of population and buildings)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Simulating an initial infection-wave](#runIni) to be used in defining one of the tested strategies\n",
    "\t—> Be aware that here exists a checkpoint for the user \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. [Define vaccination orders](#defOrder) for different vaccination strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Running simulations with different vaccination-fractions](#runVacScreen) of the population, for the different strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [Generating a plot](#plots), resembling figure 3 in our manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware, that we set the default world to be used to the small version, in order to avoid excessive runtimes for this demonstration. \n",
    "Since this world is not fully representative to the large world, we used for the manuscript; the infection-dynamics differ and thus the results of the vaccintion-screens do too.\n",
    "Furthermore we have set the vaccination-fraction increments to 20% (where we used 5%-steps in the manuscript), also to reduce runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be aware: Excessive Runtime!\n",
    "The (default) reduced version of the vaccination screens has a runtime of around **1-2 hours**, but there exists the possibility to use the non-reduced version (as we did in the manuscript); however be aware, that we expect a runtime of **12-36 hours** for this."
